******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

"Paris City Website" is a comprehensive web project developed as a second-year laboratory assignment at university. This site showcases the vibrant city of Paris through a multi-page structure, offering detailed information about tourist attractions, accommodations, events, and more. This website for Paris not only demonstrates technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript but also emphasizes good design practices, responsive development, and a structured approach to web development.

Project Overview

*********************************************************************


The website features a strictly hierarchical three-level structure spread across a minimum of 15 HTML pages. It includes:

----------
Home Page: Serves as the main gateway with the city's name as the header, a logo, and a styled menu. The menu provides navigation to:
	Home
	Tourist Attractions
	Accommodation
	Events
The home page also contains a description of Paris.

-------------------------
Tourist Attractions Page: Displays a gallery of at least 10 tourist attractions in Paris. Each attraction is represented by an image linked to its own dedicated page. These individual pages contain a description and a brief history of the attraction.

-------------------
Accommodation Page: Features a gallery of at least 10 different accommodation options. Each image links to a dedicated page with detailed descriptions, a gallery of at least 5 images, and a booking form for users interested in making a reservation. The form collects all necessary information using standard form elements.

------------
Events Page: Provides information on events happening in Paris over the next week. 

-------------
Contact Page: Contains a validated contact form where users can submit their questions or suggestions.

Design and Functionality

**********************************************************************


All pages share a consistent design, including:

	- A styled navigation menu.
	- Galleries where images of attractions and accommodations are organized in rows of five images, each with a caption underneath.
	- Dynamic elements such as image carousels (on larger screens) or transformed galleries for enhanced user experience.


**********************************************************************
Responsive Design

**********************************************************************


The website has been carefully adapted to be responsive across various devices:

	Small Devices: The navigation menu transforms into a hamburger menu for easy access. Image galleries display one image per row vertically.
	Medium Devices: Galleries adjust to display two images per row. Additional layout modifications further improve usability.
	Large Devices: Features such as an image carousel are activated, and galleries might transform into a carousel for a more interactive experience. Other layout enhancements ensure an optimal viewing experience on desktops.

At least two additional adjustments have been implemented for each device size to enhance usability and aesthetics.
